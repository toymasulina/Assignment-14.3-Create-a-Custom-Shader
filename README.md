# Assignment 14.3: Create a Custom Shader

- Create a custom shader.
- Apply custom shaders to objects in a scene.

You have now reached the point where you can write your own custom shaders! Open the scene you worked in for the randomness, noise, and surface shading screencasts. This scene includes additional shaders that were not covered in the screencasts. 

Instructions:

- Program three of your own custom shaders and label them—make at least one unlit shader and one surface shader. The third can be a shader type of your choice. Every shader you create should include shader properties that can be changed in the Unity Editor. 
- Apply your shaders to the various objects in a Unity scene to show how they are displayed.
